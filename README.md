## Vertex Color Map

**Vertex Color Map** is a handy Blender extension designed to streamline your vertex color workflow. With just a few clicks, you can quickly assign values to specific vertex color channels:
- **AO (Ambient Occlusion)** in the Red channel
- **Edges** in the Green channel
- **Metallic** in the Blue channel
- **Roughness** in the Alpha channel

Built to speed up common tasks, this extension helps you focus on creating rather than fiddling with settings!

## Disclaimer

This is my first-ever Blender extension! The code may not be perfect, it's more of a ‘stitched-together’ solution that works well enough for my workflow needs. **Vertex Color Map** was made to save me time and make my life easier, and I hope it does the same for you.

If you encounter any bugs or issues, just know it’s part of the charm!
